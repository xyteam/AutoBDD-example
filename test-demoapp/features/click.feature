Feature: Test how clicks are handled on a certain element
    As a developer
    I want to be able to test how (double) clicks are handled by certain elements

    Background:
        Given I open the path "/"

    Scenario: Single click on a link should navigate to another page
        When  I click on the link "Navigate to example.com"
        Then  I expect the full URL to contain "https://example.com"

    @Isolate
    Scenario: Single click on the button #toggleMessage should display an message
        When  I click the element "#toggleMessage"
        Then  I expect that the element "#message1" is visible
        And   I expect that the element "#message2" is not visible

    Scenario: Double click on the button #toggleMessage should display another message
        When  I double click on the button "#toggleMessage"
        Then  I expect that the element "#message1" is not visible
        And   I expect that the element "#message2" is visible

    Scenario: Single click on the element #toggleBackground should make the elemnt red
        When  I click the element "#toggleBackground"
        And   the css attribute "background-color" from element "#toggleBackground" is "rgba(255,0,0,1)"

    Scenario: Double click on the element #toggleBackground should make the elemnt blue
        When  I double click on the element "#toggleBackground"
        And   the css attribute "background-color" from element "#toggleBackground" is "rgba(0,0,255,1)"
